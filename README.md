Nowadays shopping malls and Big Marts keep the track of their sales data of each and every individual item for predicting future demand of the customer and update the inventory management as well. These data stores basically contain a large number of customer data and individual item attributes in a data warehouse. Further, anomalies and frequent patterns are detected by mining the data store from the data warehouse. The resultant data can be used for predicting future sales volume with the help of different machine learning techniques for the retailers like Big Mart. In this paper, we propose a predictive model using Xgboost technique for predicting the sales of a company like Big Mart and found that the model produces better performance as compared to existing models. A comparative analysis of the model with others in terms performance metrics is also explained in details. This report consists of following chapters: In Chapter 1 we discuss briefly about the Introduction to project and sales forecasting. In Chapter 2 we describe dataset and various methods used. Chapter 3 contains a software and hardware requirements. Implementation and screenshot of output is included in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 contain conclusions of the project. Limitations and future enhancement are discussed in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 respectively. 
Keywords: Machine Learning, Sales Forecasting, Regression, Decision Tree, Xgboost.
